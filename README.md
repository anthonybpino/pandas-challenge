After sorting and analyzing school data in a Jupyter notebook, it seems that school budget had a seemingly negative effect on how well a student tested in math and reading. Schools with lower budgets showed higher average test scores than those with higher budgets. Charter schools outperformed district schools in every test metric, the largest gap being between percentage of students passing math (93% in charter schools, 66% in district schools). One other item of note, overall passing percentages plumets when school sizes are large (2000-5000 students) compared to smaller schools (<2000 students). 

The data could show that smaller schools with smaller class sizes yield stronger test scores. It could be that individual students receive more attention when class sizes are smaller. The top five highest performing schools (by overall % passing) were all charter schools, while the bottom performing schools were all district schools. In fact, the highest performing school, Cabrera High School (95.58% overall passing rate), had one of the lowest budgets per student ($582). Spending more money per student does not equal better testing results.
